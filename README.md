This git repository was built through out the Tufts Comp 116 class on Computer Security
in order to collect all of the assignments.

My favoritate assignment was the alarm assignment as it was eye opening how easy it was to start building
my own analysis code for server logs. It was especially interesting having previously done some web devleopment
and ignoring the server logs up until this point.

I believe I have grown substantially from the first day of the course as I now have am more aware of potential
security concerns and have a better understanding on what topics I don't know.

The most important thing I have learned from this course is the importance of specialization. This came through one
of the lectures as a comment from one of the defcon speakers and also from the final project. While performing the
research for the final paper it became apparent that someone could spend his/her entire life examinging the security
of mesh networks which is a subset of the subset security. As such it became painfully clear that it is impossible to
become an expert in all fields of computer science and that specialization is essential.

The topic I wish I had more time to delve deeper into is network analysis whether from file logs or the topology of 
mesh networks. This is because it seems like a rich field that has a lot of hidden data that could be found through
vizulization and data mining.
